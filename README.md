## YOLOv8-LS：
This is an improved model based on YOLOv8 for road damage detection, featuring lightweight and scale-aware enhancements.

## CODE：
you can get the official  YOLOv8 code at https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics, 
get the pruning code at https://github.com/VainF/Torch-Pruning

and then add our improvement code to the project.

the code in project format is still being organized.

## DATASETS：

the RDD2022 dataset is available at  https://github.com/sekilab/RoadDamageDetector 

the Pothole Detection Dataset is available at https://learnopencv.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/pothole_dataset.zip
